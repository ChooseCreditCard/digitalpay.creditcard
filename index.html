    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Do We Mean by “Digital Card Payments”?</h2>
      <p>
        Digital card payments cover everything that happens when you use a card number without physically inserting plastic into a terminal. That includes mobile wallets, tap-to-pay with NFC, in-app payments, saved cards in online accounts and recurring subscriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though it feels like “just an app”, most of these payments still run on traditional card networks such as Visa, Mastercard or American Express. The main difference is the <strong>presentation</strong> of your card (phone, watch, browser) and the <strong>security model</strong> (tokens instead of full card numbers).
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Payment Flow -->
    <section id="flow" class="section">
      <h2>From Tap to Settlement – The Digital Payment Flow</h2>
      <p>
        When you tap a phone or card on a contactless reader, the terminal sends an authorization request through the payment network, just as with a chip-and-PIN purchase. The key difference is that digital wallets often use a
        <strong>device-specific token</strong> instead of your raw 16-digit card number.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind the scenes, the steps generally look like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Device authentication</strong> – You unlock the device with biometrics or a passcode.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Tokenized card details</strong> – The wallet uses a payment token representing your card, not the actual PAN.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Authorization request</strong> – The terminal submits an encrypted request via the acquirer to the card network.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Issuer decision</strong> – The bank or card issuer checks balance, risk indicators and device data before approving or declining.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Clearing &amp; settlement</strong> – The transaction is batched and settled between banks in the background, often a day or two later.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For card-on-file and subscription payments, steps 3–5 repeat on a schedule using stored credentials, sometimes with different rules for low-value or recurring transactions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Security & Tokenization -->
    <section id="security" class="section">
      <h2>Security, Tokenization and Card-on-File</h2>
      <p>
        Digital payments rely heavily on <strong>tokenization</strong>. Instead of sending your real card number, the issuer or network generates a surrogate token that can only be used in limited contexts – for example on one device, with one merchant or within one wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key security layers typically include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device security</strong> – Biometrics, secure elements and OS-level protections on phones and wearables.</li>
        <li><strong>Network tokenization</strong> – Tokens issued by card networks that map back to your real card only inside secure infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Merchant controls</strong> – Limits on which merchants can charge a stored token and under which conditions (amount, frequency, currency).</li>
        <li><strong>Risk engines</strong> – Issuer fraud systems that evaluate location, device behaviour and transaction history in real time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For you as a cardholder, this typically means <strong>lower risk of card detail theft</strong> compared with repeatedly typing your full number into websites or leaving a physical card imprint with many merchants.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Fees & Acceptance -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fees, Acceptance and Where Digital Payments Work Best</h2>
      <p>
        From the cardholder’s perspective, fees for digital payments are usually the same as for physical card usage: any FX margins, cash-advance rules, surcharges and interest come from the <strong>card product</strong>, not the technology channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acceptance, however, can vary:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some countries or merchants still require chip-and-PIN for higher amounts.</li>
        <li>Transit systems may support tap-to-pay but not all wallet brands.</li>
        <li>Online subscriptions might only accept certain networks or wallet integrations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When comparing cards in a digital-first world, you should still pay attention to <strong>FX fees, ATM rules, cash-advance definitions and interest</strong> – even if you plan to “never touch plastic” again.
